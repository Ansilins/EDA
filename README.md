# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Learning Repository

Welcome to the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Learning Repository! This repository is dedicated to helping individuals dive deep into the fascinating world of EDA, focusing on univariate analysis and expanding to cover more analysis types in the future.

## About Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

is an essential step in the data analysis process where analysts explore datasets to understand their underlying structure, patterns, and relationships. Through EDA, analysts can uncover insights, identify trends, and generate hypotheses for further investigation.

## Contents:

1. **Univariate Analysis:**
   - Explore Python code snippets demonstrating univariate analysis techniques.
   - Includes data loading, cleaning, manipulation, and visualization.
   - Visualizations include histograms, bar plots, box plots, and more.
   - Concepts covered include data distribution, central tendency, dispersion, and outlier detection.

## Future Plans:
As of now, the repository covers univariate analysis extensively. However, we plan to expand our coverage to include bivariate and multivariate analysis in the future. Stay tuned for updates!
