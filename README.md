# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Learning Repository

Welcome to the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Learning Repository! This repository is dedicated to helping individuals dive deep into the fascinating world of EDA, focusing on univariate analysis.

## About Univariate Analysis:

Univariate analysis involves examining the characteristics of a single variable in isolation, without considering its relationship with other variables. Through univariate analysis, analysts gain insights into the distribution, central tendency, dispersion, and other properties of individual variables.

## Contents:

1. **Sample Codes:**
   - Explore Python code snippets demonstrating univariate analysis techniques.
   - Includes data loading, cleaning, manipulation, and visualization.

2. **Visualizations:**
   - Discover a rich collection of visualizations showcasing different aspects of univariate analysis.
   - Includes histograms, bar plots, box plots, and more.

3. **EDA Concepts:**
   - Delve into fundamental concepts such as data distribution, central tendency, dispersion, and outlier detection.
   - Each concept is explained with clear examples and interactive visualizations.

4. **Sample Datasets:**
   - Practice your univariate analysis skills with a diverse selection of sample datasets.
   - Includes datasets from various domains, providing opportunities for exploration at different skill levels.
